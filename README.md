bash_prompt
===========

This bash prompt clearly and consisely lays out a whole bunch of useful
status information to make your bash session an even more joyous experience!
The main design ethos was to break apart output from individual bash commands
very clearly, show status information only when needed and place information on
the screen where it's most relevant.  So, for example, I place a blank line and
horizontal rule between each command, display the exit status as a coloured UTF
character right next where you're contuing your train of thought and place the
completion time of your previous command way over to the right, so it's there
if you want it but not cluttering your line of sight.

Features include:
* Dynamic layout (resizes according to the width of your terminal, truncates
  long working directory path if necessary)
* Previous command exit status and completion time
* Git status (including pending pushes/merges)
* Number of background jobs (including stopped jobs)
* Number of connected tmux sessions
* Native bash
